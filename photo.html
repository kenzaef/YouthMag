        <p>To be honest, I can’t give a correct reason why you should take
            pictures of others. A lot of times, I just wish people would take
            pictures of me. Not for the social media, also not for framing
            them. But for the memories.</p>

        <p>For that one outfit I spent my whole
            day planning and never actually knew what it looked like on me.
            For that realy funny moment when someone told a joke and 
            everyone started howling. Or maybe for the day I found my
            lost cat and was crying with her in my arms.</p>

        <p>I don't want the pictures because I’m afraid I won't remember
            these events, I want them so I can see the way the world and 
            I looked like in one special moment when the shutter went off.</p>

        <p>The cool thing with photography is you can catch a complex
            moment full of emotion and freze it in time, in a perfect and 
            still representation of it. When everyting seemed to stop and 
            pose for the camera.</p>

  <p>I take pictures of my friends because I think it;s the best gift I
    could give them. Capturing the exact second someone falls in
    love, or the moment someone hears their favourite song is
    such an authentic and touching act. Seeing ourselves and
    being able to relive a specific moment in the past is such a 
    beuatiful experience.</p>

    <p>As a photographer, I strive to tell a story. Sometimes it happens
        without actually trying. All it took to transform a basic picture
        of my boyfriend getting a haircut into a powerful, personal
        portrait was one look at the perfect timing.</p>

    <p>The chemistry between the lens and the subject is sometimes
        all it takes for a picture to be meaningful. When the subject
        I am photographing has a good energy that mixes well with
        mine and the environment, a good shot is born. If you’re 
        having a bad day taking photos and can’t really get the result 
        you want, ask yourself if you or your subject are actually
        putting out the right energy. Sometimes it’s simply the wrong
        time.</p>

    <p>It’s not always so deep. Actually most of the times I just take
        pictures because I enjoy it. I enjoy seeing my friends living
        their best lives and being able to capture that feeling
        forever. I enjoy creating memories and giving anyone the
        oppoertunity to relive them. 
        </p>

    <p>I think you should take pictures of your friends anytime you
        get the chance. You never know when you might shoot 
        something magic. The power is all in your hands, and years
        from now you’ll have a still from an ordinary night that just
        reminds you of the good and simple times you spent in
        your youth, surrounded by people you love.</p>
