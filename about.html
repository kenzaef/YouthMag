        <h1>Who am I?</h1>

        <p>My name is Kenza and I am a Multimedia Design stuent at Business Academy Aarhus. I have a passion for art, specifically photography, cinema and graphic design. I am a self taught video producer, learning video editing around 5 years ago through YouTube tutorials.</p>

        <p>I am currently learning web development and creating this online magazine has been an interesting challenge for me. Being more comfortable with content creation, rather than web design, I found it much easier to write articles and provide visual material, than to program. As I started coding, however, I became more and more comfortable and intrigued by coding, so I can confidently say creating this magazine has opened the door to a new possible passion.</p>
